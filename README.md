# FPGA-ML

Neural Networks implemented in C for synthesis to HDL and execution on an FPGA.

## Work in Progress

This project is currently a work in progress.

## Overview

FPGA-ML aims to implement some simple Neural Networks in C with the ability to synthesize the code to Hardware Description Language (HDL) and run it on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
